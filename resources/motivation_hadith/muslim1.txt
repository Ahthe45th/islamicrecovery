“Strange are the matters of believers. For him there is good in all his affairs, and this is so only for the believer. When something pleasing happens to him, he is grateful (shukr), and that is good for him; and when something displeasing happens to him he is enduring patience (sabr) and that is good for him.” [Sahih Muslim]

"الغريب من شؤون المؤمنين. له خير في كل شؤونه ، وهذا فقط للمؤمن. عندما يحدث له شيء مرضي ، يكون ممتنًا (شكر) ، وهذا جيد له ؛ وعندما يحدث له شيء مزعج ، فإنه يتحمل الصبر وهذا أمر جيد بالنسبة له ". [صحيح مسلم]
