 Jabir ibn Abdullah reported: The Messenger of Allah said:
A servant does not have faith until he believes in providence, both its good and its evil, and until he knows that what afflicts him could never have missed him and that what missed him could never have afflicted him. (At-Tirmidhi)

عن جابر بن عبد الله: قال رسول الله:

    فالعبد لا يثق حتى يؤمن بالعناية ، سواء بالخير أو بالشر ، وحتى يعرف أن ما يصيبه لا يمكن أن يفتقده وأن ما فاته لم يكن ليصيبه. (الترمذي)
