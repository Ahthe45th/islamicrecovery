The Companions’ Sincerity in Knowledge

ʿAbd Al-Raḥmān b. Abī Laylā – Allah have mercy on him – said:

I have met one hundred and twenty Companions of the Prophet – Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him; there was not one amongst them who would narrate a ḥadīth except that he wished his brother would suffice him instead, and there was not one amongst them who gave a fatwā except that he wished his brother would suffice him instead.

Ibn Al-Mubārak, Al-Zuhd wa Al-Raqā`iq Vol.1 p140, no.49.
