When masturbation is compulsive, it might be due to various reasons. For example, it may be due to:

    untreated mental health conditions
    relationship issues
    poor sexual communication or conflict resolution skills
    cultural and religious conflicts

However, having support from a trusted group of people may be helpful for some people to quell the habit. Finding a support group can give them the space they need to express concerns and develop positive coping strategies.

When a person talks openly about the challenges they face, others can help them feel validated. This can decrease any feelings of guilt or shame associated with compulsive masturbation.
