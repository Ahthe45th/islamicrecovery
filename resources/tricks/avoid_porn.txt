Exposure to pornography may trigger the desire to masturbate.

People who want to stop masturbating should avoid pornographic movies, images, and websites. If a person can place a barrier between themselves and pornography, it can help them break the habit.

It is now very easy to access pornography in just a few seconds. However, people can try to limit their access to pornography by using filters on electronic devices that block certain types of content, such as pornographic material.

Although a person can unblock such websites, taking the time to do so can give them time to regain control of their impulses and allow the urge to pass.
