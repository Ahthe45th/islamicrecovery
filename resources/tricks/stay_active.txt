It can be helpful for a person to find ways to occupy their time that does not trigger the desire to masturbate.

Finding outlets for energy release can replace the time spent masturbating. People can consider taking up a new hobby or learning a new skill, such as learning a musical instrument or trying a new sport.

Developing new goals can help a person refocus their energy and find excitement and fulfillment in other things.

It may also be helpful to determine when the urge to masturbate is highest and plan other activities for that time.
