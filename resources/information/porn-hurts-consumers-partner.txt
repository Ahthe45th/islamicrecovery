How Porn Hurts A Consumer's Partner


Partners of porn consumers often report feeling angry, confused, and betrayed when they find out that the other half of their committed relationship has been watching porn. Consumers may have no idea how they are hurting their own relationships and the people they love.

No one ever woke up and said, “Today, I want to get out there and ruin my current and future relationships. I’m going to cut myself off emotionally, undermine trust, and leave my partner feeling confused, rejected, angry, and betrayed.”

No one says that, but a pile of research shows that’s exactly what can happen as a result of consuming porn.

It’s probably no surprise that women tend to view porn and its effects very differently from men. 

If you want to do a huge favor for the love of your life, decide now that you won’t bring the potentially devastating effects of porn into your relationship. Or, if you’re already caught in porn’s web, make the decision to get help. Click here to find out how you can give them the gift they really want: You. All of you. Heart and Mind.
