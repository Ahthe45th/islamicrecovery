How Porn Warps Ideas About Sex


Whether they want to or not, the majority of teens are getting some of their sex education from porn. Researchers have repeatedly found that people who have seen a significant amount of porn are more likely to start having sex sooner and with more partners; and to engage in riskier kinds of sex, putting them at greater risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.

Imagine what would happen if your school’s health class was taught by a cigarette salesman. Chances are, you wouldn’t hear much about lung cancer or how much shorter the typical smoker’s lifespan is. He might even try to tell you that smoking could boost your sprint time. Sounds ridiculous, right? But that’s the kind of education millions of teens are getting about sex every day.

While porn is often called “adult material,” many of its viewers are well under the legal age.  (See How Porn Changes the Brain.) Images are especially powerful teachers since they can pack in a whole lot of information that the viewer can understand very quickly. And while words are often interpreted as mere opinions, our brains are more likely to accept images as facts. After all, it’s a lot more difficult to argue with something you’re seeing happen in front of you.  And think about it, what messages does that send to young women and girls who are consuming this content as well?

That’s what porn is: indoctrination, the process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically. It isn’t just entertainment. It isn’t just titillating. It teaches a detrimental message from a specific worldview. We can limit the advancement of porn’s ideals by spreading the truth, especially to young people. And for those who feel caught up in porn’s web, it’s never too late to stop and even turn back its harmful effects. Click here to find out how.
