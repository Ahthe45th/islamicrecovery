So first of all while we are designing the app before we do it we have to agree
On what every element of the design will look like. So the background, the images
on various buttons the background images on text etc

then once weve done that and we know with some certainty what each part will look like
we can download and install these things called widgets which will help us create 
various looks for the app.
Thats how we go about design.
